## Predictions as of March 10, 2022
### 1. Scenario: NATO vs Russia war
- Three ways this could become a NATO vs Russia war:
	1. NATO could decide to escalate its involvement in Ukraine by, for example, attempting to implement a no-fly zone or another form of direct intervention
	2. Russia could inadvertently strike a NATO member’s territory—for example, through imprecise targeting or erroneous identification of friend and foe—prompting countermeasures from the alliance
	3. If Russian forces make rapid progress in Ukraine and achieve effective control over the country, Putin may turn his attention to states that he covets as part of a desire to reconstitute a sphere of influence that broadly aligns with the territory of the former Soviet Union

Predictors:
- Atlantic Council's Barry Pavel, Peter Engelke, and Jeffrey Cimmino
	- See Scenario 4: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/four-ways-the-war-in-ukraine-might-end/

### 2. Scenario: Russian victory & new cold war
- Ukraine eventually collapses under the weight of the Russian invasion. Despite intense opposition, Russian forces manage to take control of the country through the use of increasingly heavy-handed weapons and tactics.
- While Russia faces steep economic costs, Putin solidifies his hold on power internally, quashing domestic dissent even more forcefully
- New Iron Curtain falls. and a cold war is fought by both sides
- Highly unlikely that Russia would launch direct military attacks against NATO forces, so he resorts to indirect attacks:
		- Russia sponsors Chechen terrorism in Europe and cyber attacks
		- etc
- NATO and Russia prepare themselves for a long, bumpy standoff, with no clear outcome and no guarantee of a peaceful resolution.

Predictors:
- Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group’s president
- Atlantic Council's Barry Pavel, Peter Engelke, and Jeffrey Cimmino
	- See Scenario 3: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/four-ways-the-war-in-ukraine-might-end/

### 3. Scenario: Puppet state in Eastern Ukraine

- By June 2022, Russia gains “patchy control of eastern Ukraine, up to the Dnipro River”, captures Kyiv after a protracted siege, and declares a puppet government. A rump Ukrainian state is led from Lviv and continues receiving significant western support. 5-10 million refugees leave Ukraine.
- A possible scenario is that Russia partitions the conquered parts of the country, and pushes Ukrainians out of the partitioned areas.
- The most likely candidate for who Putin installs as leader of the puppet state is install former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.

Predictors:
- Eurasia Group's chairman, Cliff Kupchan
- Taras Kuzio, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society

### 4. Scenario: Quagmire
- Quagmire: Initial invasion success, then insurgency, devastation, and Russian withdrawal
- Ukrainians successfully fight an insurgency, and “the conflict drains Moscow’s coffers and resolve, ultimately forcing a withdrawal after much violence and death”
- Russia is a pariah state at a global level and withdrawing after a costly invasion.
- Ukraine would be “devastated” in the process.

Predictors:
- Yuval Noah Harari

- Atlantic Council's Barry Pavel, Peter Engelke, and Jeffrey Cimmino
	- See Scenario 2: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/four-ways-the-war-in-ukraine-might-end/

### 5. Scenario: Negotiated Peace
- Someone successfully negotiates an end. Turkey, India, China and Israel have all offered their assistance.

### 6. Scenario: Ukrainian victory
- Ukraine could see its own defensive capabilities bolstered by NATO, allowing its military and civilian resistance to “overcome the odds and grind Moscow’s advance to a halt.” Putin would be prevented from toppling Kyiv’s government and establishing a puppet regime, while “the determination and skill of the Ukrainian resistance forces a stalemate on the battlefield that favors the defenders."
- This may also lead to Putin's overthrow
- Russian armed forces withdraw. This may occur after Putin declares he won in order to save face.

Predictors:
- Atlantic Council's Barry Pavel, Peter Engelke, and Jeffrey Cimmino
	- See Scenario 1: https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/four-ways-the-war-in-ukraine-might-end/

### 7. Scenario: Ukrainian victory & Russia collapse
- Like Ukrainian victory scenario, but the military losses by Russia lead to a collapse of Russia.
